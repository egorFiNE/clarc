.SH DESCRIPTION

.B clarc 
invocation are uploaded.

.B clarc 
keeps track of changes by storing file metadata in a small local database. It possible to quickly rebuild the database from Amazon S3.

.B rebuild 
is done first. This is the most failsafe mode of operation.

\fB\-\-upload\fR
Actually upload files to Amazon S3.
.TP
\fB\-\-rebuild\fR
Download files list and meta information from Amazon S3 and rebuild local database from scratch.

\fB\-\-source <path> 
.B (*)

.TP
\fB\-\-exclude <pattern> 
Ignore certain files/folders according to the Regular Expression pattern. There could be more than a single --exclude argument.
